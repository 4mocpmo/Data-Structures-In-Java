How to calculate Time and Space complexity of a Algorithm?

<b>Time Complexity</b> =>
===============

Let's start with basic mathematics. What are the basic operations that we can do?
	- Addition
	- Subtraction
	- Multiplication
	- Division
	
When we talk about addition, say we have to add two 4 digit numbers i.e 3498 and 2309
How many times we have to do operation? 4 times i.e Adding 8 with 9, 9 with 0, 4 with 3 and 3 with 2
Same is the case with subtraction. We have to do operation 4 times. 
So, for both addition and subtraction we have 
	Number of Operations = Number of Elements 
This results in linear complexity i.e O(N)
