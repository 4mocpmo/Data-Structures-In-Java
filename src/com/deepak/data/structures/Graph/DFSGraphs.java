 * Depth First Search implemented for graphs

 * 	1. Push the root element to Stack
 * 	2. Loop until stack is empty
 * 	3. Peek the node from the Stack
 * 	4. If the node has unvisited child nodes, get those nodes, push to Stack and mark as visited
 * 	5. If the node does not have any unvisited child node, pop it from the Stack.
