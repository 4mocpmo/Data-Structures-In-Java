## Caching

Caching is a technique of storing the data in a temporary place since fetching the original data over API call can be expensive. From cache, we can retrieve it faster.
Cache is made of pool of entries, which are copy of real data. Each entry is associated with a tag (key identifier) which is used for retrival. 

Here are some of the terms used with caching, 
1. Cache Hit
2. Cache Miss
3. Storage Cost
4. Retrival Cost
5. Invalidation
6. Replacement policy
